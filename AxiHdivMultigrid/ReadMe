%Program Description:By using multigrid, this program solves the matrix 
%system Ax=b arising from the Fourier-FEMs applied to the H(div) problem
%on an axisymmetric domain for Fourier modes not equal to zero.
%
%Details can be found in the following paper:
%   https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmaa.2020.124209
%
% How to run main.m: 
%
%Input: 
% 1. Make mesh1.mat, mesh2.mat, ... , through the final mesh corresponding to
% your domain that contains variables [p,e,t,BdyEdges,new_ele]
%  (1) p,e,t has the same format as those created by using Matlab's "initmesh"
%  (2) BdyEdges is a vector of length the same as the number of edges in the
%      mesh. If the i-th edge is on the boundary then BdyEdges(i)=1 and zero
%      otherwise.
%  (3) new_ele is a matrix of size Number of Elements by 3. The i-th row of
%      new_ele saves the three edge numbers that makes the i-th triangle.
% 2. Save RHS_r.m, RHS_theta.m, RHS_z.m where 
% F(r,z)=(RHS_r(r,z), RHS_theta(r,z), RHS_z(r,z)) is the input function
% 3. n: Fourier_mode of interest not equal to zero.
% 4. mesh_level: The final mesh level to solve the Ax=b system.
%
% Output: The soltuion vector x to Ax=b. (x=main(mesh_level,n))
